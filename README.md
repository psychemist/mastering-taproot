### About the Book

*Mastering Taproot* is a developer-focused, reproducible guide to Bitcoin’s most powerful upgrade — Taproot.

This manuscript emphasizes:

- full code samples
- real testnet transactions
- precise stack execution
- minimal abstractions

The goal is not to “explain concepts”, but to **engineer them** — from single-leaf script spends, to multi-path Merkle tree constructions, to privacy-preserving control blocks.

Foundational Bitcoin engineering knowledge should be reproducible, inspectable, and forkable — therefore this work is published open-access.

---

### Audience

This project is intended for:

- Developers learning Bitcoin programming through hands-on construction (Chapters 1–8 provide a complete on-ramp)
- Bitcoin protocol engineers and Script / Taproot developers
- Wallet and key management system designers
- Researchers studying Schnorr signatures, Merkle commitments, or Taproot privacy
- Anyone interested in Taproot's advanced applications: Ordinals, RGB, Lightning, and Silent Payments (Chapters 9–12)

---

### Status

This is an active public draft. The full 12-chapter structure is now published.

| Chapters | Manuscript | Code | Maturity |
|----------|-----------|------|----------|
| Ch 1–8 | ✅ Published | ✅ Tested & published | **Stable** — all code tested on testnet |
| Ch 9 | ✅ Published | ✅ Published | **Stable** — code tested on testnet |
| Ch 10–12 | ✅ Published | 📝 In progress | **Draft** — structure and narrative complete; code examples in manuscripts not yet fully tested. Issues and PRs welcome. |

The framework-first, code-iterative approach: the complete narrative arc from private keys to Silent Payments is in place. Code for Chapters 10–12 will be refined and uploaded incrementally.

### How to Use This Repository

1. **Read the Manuscript**

   All chapters:
   
   [`book/manuscript/`](./book/manuscript/)
   
   Start with `SUMMARY.md` for the full outline.

2. **Run the Code**

   Every chapter's runnable examples live in [`code/`](./code/).
   
   All scripts include:
   
   - deterministic key generation
   - raw transaction hex construction
   - witness stack building
   - sighash verification
   - control block validation (Taproot)
   
   Scripts target Bitcoin testnet and require only Python 3.

3. **Verify Against the Network**

   Most examples produce:
   
   - a real testnet transaction ID
   - a decodeable raw transaction
   - validation steps you can run in Core (`decoderawtransaction`, `testmempoolaccept`, etc.)

---

### How to Contribute

Pull requests are welcome.

Typical contribution areas:

- typo fixes / formatting
- improved explanations / diagrams
- corrections to code samples
- additional reproducible testnet transactions

If you open an Issue, please include:

- chapter + section
- reproduction steps (if code)
- expected vs actual behavior

This project values *precision and reproducibility* above abstraction or opinions.

### Recent Updates

For chapters, code releases, and script changes: [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md)

---

### Roadmap

Upcoming work:

• Code examples for Chapters 10–12 (incremental uploads as they reach testnet-verified stability)
